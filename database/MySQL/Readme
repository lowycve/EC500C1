Report for MySQL and MongoDB
For both MySQL and MongoDB, the user have to follow some certain format of data to insert to the database, for MySQL, the user
needs to indicate how many variables their database has and shows what type of data, like integer or text. For MongoDB, the
data insert must be in dictionary type. For both database, they are able to store a huge amount of data in a really short time.
They all have API for many different languages which is really convinient for user.
MySQL allows the user to set password for their database while it's better at keeping users' privacy, while MongoDB doesn't 
support those kind of things.By using MongoDb, the user will have to open the port first, which allows the user to insert data,
but with MySQL, sometimes you don't really have to do that. MySQL will generate a db file after inserting all the data, which is
more visable for user, you will have to download some software like ROBO 3T to see the data in MongoDB.
