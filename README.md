# General Idea
Basically, this API is the combination usage of tweepy, FFMPEG and Google Vision, which is able to download the pictures of a certain Twitter user, then convert them into video, and obtain the detected labels of objects in the picture by Google Vison.

# Navigator
The code folder contains the code that use to solve this problem, and result.txt is the result generated by the code.

# How to run the code
To run the code, you need to fill in your twitter account information at the begining of the code, then install google cloud package, obtain a json file that contains your google account information and download google cloud sdk. Make sure include the json file in the same directory as your code.
When everything is done, type 'python api.py' in terminal, and type the twitter user name you want to search for. The pictures will atuomatically download to your folder and the result.txt will also been generated.
When the user name you typed is not exsit, or there is no tweet, picture for the user, the program will tell you which situation happened and shut down.
